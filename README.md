TASK 2 ( Customer Churn Prediction )

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Customer churn refers to the scenario where customers stop using a product or service. The aim is to develop a predictive model using historical data that includes customer demographics and usage behavior.

Project Workflow:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and processed historical customer data, including relevant features such as demographics (e.g., age, location) and usage patterns (e.g., frequency of use, subscription length).

2. Model Selection:
A Decision Tree classifier was selected for this task, which effectively handles categorical data and captures non-linear patterns.

3. Training:
The model was trained on a labeled dataset to learn from customer behavior and demographic features, identifying patterns that may indicate churn.

4. Prediction:
After training, the model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn, based on their features.

5. Evaluation:
Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Technologies Used:

Python: For data processing and model building.
Decision Tree Classifier: For classification of customer churn.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the machine learning model and evaluation metrics.
